# Pawpulation Forecast Dashboard

This code creates the streamlit dashboard that's part of the UC Berkeley Pawpulation Forecast capstone project.

### Installing the Depenencies

This codebase requires a minimal set of depencies. You can automatically install the dependencies into a virtual environment with
[conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) using the following command:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

You can then activate the newly created `capstone` environment with the following command:

```
conda activate capstone
```

### Running the streamlit app

Once the depencies installed and you are running the `capstone` virtual environment, run the following command:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

This will bring up a window in your browser which displays the dashboard.
